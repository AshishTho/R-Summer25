## 🏆 Final Project: Macroeconomic Indicators and S&P 500 Returns

### Research Question
**Do lagged unemployment and inflation explain subsequent S&P 500 quarterly total returns (1980‑2024)?**

### Key Findings
- **Significant Predictor**: Lagged inflation significantly predicts S&P 500 returns (p = 0.049)
- **Economic Insight**: Higher inflation expectations lead to lower subsequent equity returns (β = -0.037)
- **Model Performance**: Explains ~10% of return variation (R² = 0.098)
- **Sample Size**: 41 quarterly observations spanning 44 years

### Data Sources
- **UNRATE**: Civilian unemployment rate (Monthly, %) - Federal Reserve
- **CPIAUCSL**: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (Monthly, index) - Bureau of Labor Statistics
- **^GSPC**: S&P 500 close prices (Daily, index) - Yahoo Finance via FRED

*All data retrieved from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API on July 23, 2025.*

### Advanced Methods Used
- **Econometric Techniques**: Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation corrected (HAC) standard errors
- **Data Engineering**: Automated frequency alignment (daily/monthly → quarterly)
- **API Integration**: Real-time data download from FRED database
- **Time Series Analysis**: Lag structure implementation for predictive modeling

### Academic Context
This research extends the predictive modeling framework of:
- **Fama & Schwert (1977)**: Asset returns and inflation relationships
- **Rapach, Strauss & Zhou (2010)**: Out-of-sample equity premium prediction
